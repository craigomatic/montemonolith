# Part 4 - Decompose the original monolith

### Next we'll pull a feature out of the original monolith and host it in a separate microservice

Our sample project isn't very complex so the list of tasks to decompose is fairly small. In this example we pull out the Simulation API and add it into a new project called 'MonteMonolith.SimulateService'
